## üõ†Ô∏è Engineer's Quick Rules

**Golden Rules for Building BETTROI BOS Agents:**

1. **Tag every task with a KPI or do not run it**
2. **Gate risky operations with HITL and ABAC rules**
3. **Write Task Contracts (purpose, scopes, KPIs, rollback)**
4. **Measure with evals and SLOs; halt when error budget is burned**
5. **Protect data (PDPL/DPDP/GDPR + PII/PHI/PCI + residency)**
6. **Make changes reversible (versioning, canaries, rollbacks)**
