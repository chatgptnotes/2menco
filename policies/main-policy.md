- **Quality** - How good is your work?
- **Security** - How safe is everything?

## 🚨 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Triggers

Robots must ask humans for help when:
- **SEV-1/2 incidents** - Something breaks badly
- **Breach indicators** - Security problems
- **Scope conflicts** - Robots disagree
- **New segments** - Trying new customer types
- **Claim-sensitive** - Making big promises
- **Brand risk** - Could hurt your reputation
- **Discount > policy** - Giving bigger discounts than allowed
- **Term changes** - Changing important rules
- **New vendor** - Working with new suppliers
- **Unusual terms** - Strange contract conditions
- **Payment ≥ threshold** - Big payments (≥ AED 10,000)
- **Anomalies** - Something looks suspicious
- **Complaints** - Customer problems
- **Regulated advice** - Legal/financial advice needed
- **Low confidence** - Robot isn't sure what to do

## 🔄 RCA & CAPA (Problem Solving)

**RCA** = Root Cause Analysis (Why did this happen?)
**CAPA** = Corrective and Preventive Actions (How do we fix it and prevent it?)

**When to trigger RCA:**
- KPI variance > ±10%
- SEV-1/2 incidents

**CAPA Process:**
1. **Contain** - Stop the problem from getting worse
2. **Root cause** - Find out why it happened
3. **Corrective fix** - Fix the immediate problem
4. **Preventive change** - Change rules to prevent it happening again
5. **Verify** - Make sure the fix works
6. **Close** - Mark it as done

## 📊 Default Thresholds

- **Payments dual-control** ≥ AED 10,000
- **New vendor** requires Seller approval + compliance checklist
- **Outreach caps** 2 emails + 1 WhatsApp/week/contact (unless opted-in)
